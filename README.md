# StarshipLaunchExpansion_KSP
Thanks for trying out this mod! This is a public beta of Starship Launch Expansion Mod so be aware that the mod may have bugs when you install it.

KSP | Starship Launch Expansion | Mod Version: KSP 1.11.2 or previous. 

Note: The mod is made for KSP 1.11.2 mainly, so it's not sure if it will work perfectly on older versions, but it should.

I'm working on this mod mainly by my own, so please be patient with updates, any suggestions or bug reports you can text me through discord: @SAMCG14#6374 or join my discord server: https://discord.gg/AQBSvm9mw9
